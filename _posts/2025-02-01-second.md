## The Journey of Building This Site

I decided to build my personal website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Here's what I learned along the way:

### Why Jekyll?
- Simple to use
- Great for blogging
- Free hosting with GitHub Pages
- Markdown support

### The Process
Setting up the site was surprisingly straightforward. The hardest part was understanding how Jekyll's directory structure works, but once I got that down, everything else fell into place.

### Next Steps
I'm planning to add more features like:
- A portfolio section
- Better blog categorization
- Maybe some interactive elements

Stay tuned for more updates!
